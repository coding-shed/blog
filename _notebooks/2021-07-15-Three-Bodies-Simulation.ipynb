    "### Simulating trajectories of 3 celestial bodies\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> Today we are going to simulate paths of 3 moving celestial bodies. To do so, we don't need maths or astro-physics degree. In today's day and age, world class computational tools are at out fingertips. We're going to leverage them to solve what hundred of years ago was deemed unsolvable.</p>\n",

    "### Universal Law of Gravity\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>\n",
    "The following two equations, along with godlike ingenuity, allowed Issac Newton to determine orbital position of celestial bodies at any given point in time. First is the Universal Law of Gravity, which states that gravitational force between two bodies is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their distance. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "{F} = {G} \\times \\frac{m_1 m_2}{{r}^2}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>\n",
    "Second equation is Newtown's Second Law of Motion. It tells us that with constant mass, net force applied to a body yields proportional acceleration.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "{F} = {m_1} \\times {a}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>\n",
    "Combining those two facts i.e. equating those two definitions of force, gives a way to infer about object acceleration. But since we want to follow objects path in 3 dimensions, we have to turn above equation into vector form. Force and acceleration both have direction. In order to reflect that, we can add unit vector (with a hat) that points from body m<sub>1</sub> towards body m<sub>2</sub></p>\n",

    "And since unit vector is defined as vector divided by its norm, we can re-write the above into:</p>\n",

    "Subscript \"12\" means \"from 1 towards 2\" to describe vector's direction.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "### Working out the position\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>\n",
    "Now that we have acceleration, we can also derive body velocities and position. Acceleration is a derivative of velocity, and velocity is a derviative of position with respect to time. So, from acceleration we need to take two steps down: to velocity, and then to position. This can be expressed with two first order differential equations:</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introducing third celestial body\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>\n",
    "Above equations are fine for systems with 2 bodies, not three. We still need to factor in the effect the third body has on both first and second body. With each body in question, the net exerted force will be the sum of forces from two remaining bodies. For example, acceleration of body 1 can be expressed as:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial \\vec{v}_{1}}{\\partial t} & = \\frac{m_2}{r^3_{12}} \\vec{r}_{12} + \\frac{m_3}{r^3_{13}} \\vec{r}_{13} \\\\\n",

    "### Coding the equations\n",

You can see that I skipped G constant in each acceleration equation. That's because we want all parameters provided to integrator to have similator magnitudes close to unity. This will make numerical methods work much better. One other solution would be to scale all of the parameters by some reference quantities to keep relative differences between them. But here, we are not mimicking any real celestial system. It's a toy example with completely arbitrary, random values.</p>"
